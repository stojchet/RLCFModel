Your task is to complete code. Don't generate the whole document and don't add any explanations after the code completion .
For example if your input is:
```import java.util.Arrays;

public class ArraySum {

    /**
     * Function to calculate the sum of all elements in an array.
     * @param arr The input array of integers.
     * @return The sum of all elements in the array.
     *
     * > sumArray([1, 2, 3])
     * 6
     * > sumArray([2, 3, 4, 2, 6, 4])
     * 21
     */
    public static int sumArray(int[] arr) {
```
You should output:
```
        int sum = 0;
        for (int num : arr) {
            sum += num;
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```
It is very important that you do not add any explanations after this output.
